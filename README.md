# VideoCoompare
A Unity application developed as part of my master thesis degree at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.
It allows the user to import a .yuv file and encode it using either a h264 or a h265 codec.
Both the compressed and uncompressed video feeds are displayed simultaneously.
The user can change the target bitraate for the encoding process and analyze how it affects the quality of the encoded video.
The application also generates metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, NIQE and BRISQUE.
